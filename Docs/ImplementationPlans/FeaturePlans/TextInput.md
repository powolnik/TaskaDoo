# Text Input
Even though voice Task input is an important feature of TaskaDoo, ability to input Tasks through text is very important as well.\
That's because not every User will feel comfortable saying their Task out loud even at their own home (family, roommates - other people in general). Besides, it might not be appropriate in public.
