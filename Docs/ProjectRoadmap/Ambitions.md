# Ambitions

## 1. Vision

We are aiming to make an actually helpful task organization app with AI integration.\
We want to help *ourselves* and people similiar to us. That includes hardcore procrastinators, neuroatypicals, people with time blindness and generally people that always find ways to ignore reminders for tasks.\
Main feature, *selling point*, of our app-to-be is fast, voice-based task input and AI integration used for easy categorization and motivation.\
An important focus of this project is for everyone involved to work on and learn what they actually want. It is a passion project after all. If we make some money  off of it, it would be cool too.
