> ### Examples
> **1. Automated Transcription Services**
> - **Examples:** Otter.ai, Rev, Dragon NaturallySpeaking.
> - **Description:**  
>   These services use speech-to-text technology to transcribe spoken words into written text in real time. They are widely used for transcribing meetings, lectures, interviews, and creating accessible content for those with hearing impairments.  
>
> **2. Customer Service Chatbots & IVR Systems**
> - **Examples:** IBM Watson, Nuance.
> - **Description:**  
  AI-powered chatbots and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems use NLP and voice recognition to handle customer inquiries. They provide automated support, resolve common issues, and improve service efficiency by reducing the need for human operators.
>
> **3. Automotive Voice Control Systems**
> - **Examples:** BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Ford SYNC.
> - **Description:**  
>   Voice recognition systems in modern vehicles allow drivers to control navigation, multimedia, and communication functions without taking their hands off the wheel. This enhances safety and convenience by enabling a hands-free driving experience.
